[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly fromaudio.] [AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly fromaudio.] Your Eminences, Your Excellencies, Mr. President:       On behalf of Mrs. Kennedy, her children, the parents and sisters ofRobert Kennedy, I want to express what we feel to those who mourn withus today in this Cathedral and around the world.  We loved him as a brother, and as a father, and as a son. From his parents,and from his older brothers and sisters -- Joe andKathleen and Jack-- he received an inspiration which he passed on to all of us. He gaveus strength in time of trouble, wisdom in time of uncertainty, and sharingin time of happiness. He will always be by our side.  Love is not an easy feeling to put into words. Nor is loyalty, or trust,or joy. But he was all of these. He loved life completely and he livedit intensely.  A few years back, Robert Kennedy wrote some words about his own fatherwhich expresses [sic] the way we in his familyfelt about him. He said of what his father meant to him, and I quote: "Whatit really all adds up to is love -- not love as it is described with suchfacility in popular magazines, but the kind of love that is affection andrespect, order and encouragement, and support. Our awareness of this wasan incalculable source of strength, and because real love is somethingunselfish and involves sacrifice and giving, we could not help but profitfrom it." And he continued, "Beneath it all, he has tried to engender asocial conscience. There were wrongs which needed attention. There werepeople who were poor and needed help. And we have a responsibility to themand to this country. Through no virtues and accomplishments of our own,we have been fortunate enough to be born in the United States under themost comfortable conditions. We, therefore, have a responsibility to otherswho are less well off." That is what Robert Kennedy was given. What he leaves to us is whathe said, what he did, and what he stood for. A speech he made to the youngpeople of South Africa on their Day of Affirmation in 1966 sums it up thebest, and I would like to read it now:  There is discrimination in this world and slavery and slaughter andstarvation. Governments repress their people; millions are trapped in povertywhile the nation grows rich and wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere.These are differing evils, but they are the common works of man. They reflectthe imperfection of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion,our lack of sensibility towards the suffering of our fellows. But we canperhaps remember -- even if only for a time -- that those who live with us are our brothers; that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they seek -- as we do -- nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can.  Surely, this bond of common faith, this bond of common goal, can begin to teach us something. Surely, we can learn, at least, to look at those around us as fellow men. And surely we can begin to work a little harder to bind up the wounds among us and to become in our own hearts brothers and countrymen once again. The answer is to rely on youth -- not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to the obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. They cannot be moved by those who cling to a present that is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement and danger that come with even the most peaceful progress. It is a revolutionary world we         live in, and this generation at home and around the world has had thrust         upon it a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has         ever lived. Some believe there is nothing one man or one woman can do         against the enormous array of the world's ills. Yet many of the world's         great movements, of thought and action, have flowed from the work of a         single man.        A young monk began the Protestant reformation;        a young general extended an empire from Macedonia to the borders of the         earth;                a young woman reclaimed the territory of France; and it was a        young Italian explorer who discovered the New World, and the 32         year-old Thomas Jefferson who [pro]claimed that"all men are created equal." These men moved the world, and so can we all. Few will have the greatnessto bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portionof events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the historyof this generation.         Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure         of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a         rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is         the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world         that yields most painfully to change. And I believe that in this         generation those with the courage to enter the moral conflict will find         themselves with companions in every corner of the globe.         For the fortunate among us, there is the temptation to follow the easy         and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly         spread before those who enjoy the privilege of education. But that is         not the road history has marked out for us. Like it or not, we live in         times of danger and uncertainty. But they are also more open to the         creative energy of men than any other time in history. All of us will         ultimately be judged, and as the years pass we will surely judge         ourselves on the effort we have contributed to building a new world         society and the extent to which our ideals and goals have shaped that         event. * That is the way he lived. That is what he leaves us. My brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what hewas in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who sawwrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw warand tried to stop it. Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today, pray thatwhat he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to passfor all the world. As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touchedand who sought to touch him: Some men see things as they are and say why.I dream things that never were and say why not.  * Special Collections Audio:Kennedy Press Aid Frank Manckiewicz Announces the Death of Robert Francis Kennedy.mp3 Audio Source: John F.
