Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen, myname is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. I am a defendant in this case, acting as my ownattorney, and therefore have the opportunity to address you directly. It is unusualfor a defendant to represent ones self, but my comrade, Mr. Pettis Perry and I haveelected to do so. Neither of us is a lawyer. We will speak to you in thelanguage of laymen and women, I should say. I and other defendants have spokenduring the period covered by the indictment and previously on the radio, especially inpolitical campaigns in support of Communist and other candidates, including Councilmen Cacchione and Davis, and for Simon W. Gerson, a defendant present here, when he was acandidate after Mr. Cacchiones sudden death. We will prove to you that the Communist Party, U.S.A.,is not, as the indictment sets forth, a society, group or assembly of persons but is alegitimate political party. It has nominated candidates for all public offices,including that of President. We will prove that defendants here on trial have beencandidates and won substantially high votes -- Perry, Gerson, Begun, Johnson, Weinstone andWeinstock. I ran with Mr. Benjamin J. Davis for Congress-at-largein 1942 and we each received over 50,000 votes. Our campaign slogan or program for victory was:  Not an idle man. Not an idle machine. Not an idle acre.
