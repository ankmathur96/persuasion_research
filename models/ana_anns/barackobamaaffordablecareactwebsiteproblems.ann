T1	Emotional_Anecdotes 1233 1373	Many Americans   with a preexisting condition, like Janice, are discovering that they can   finally get health insurance like everybody else
T2	Credit_Claiming 232 390	About three weeks ago, as   the federal government shut down, the Affordable Care Acts health   insurance marketplaces opened for business across the country.
T3	Credit_Claiming 391 570	Well,   weve now gotten the government back open for the American people, and   today I want to talk about how were going to get the marketplaces   running at full steam, as well.
T4	Credit_Claiming 2093 2229	What the Affordable Care   Act does for you is to provide you with new benefits and protections   that have been in place for some time.
T6	Credit_Claiming 2622 2738	Another part of the Affordable Care Act is providing seniors with deeper   discounts on their prescription medicine.
T7	Credit_Claiming 2797 2818	Thats part of the law
T8	Credit_Claiming 2739 2795	Billions of dollars have been   saved by seniors already
T9	Credit_Claiming 2820 2842	Its already in   place
T10	Credit_Claiming 2844 2867	Its happening right now
T11	Credit_Claiming 2869 3000	Already, because of the   Affordable Care Act, preventive care like mammograms and birth control   are free through your employers.
T12	Credit_Claiming 3001 3023	Thats part of this law
T13	Credit_Claiming 3027 3143	So there are a wide range of consumer protections and benefits that you   already have if youve got health insurance
T14	Credit_Claiming 3145 3227	You may not have noticed   them, but youve got them, and theyre not going anywhere
T15	Credit_Claiming 3270 3325	Heres another thing that   the Affordable Care Act does
T16	Credit_Claiming 3327 3516	In states where governors and   legislatures have wisely allowed it, the Affordable Care Act provides   the opportunity for many Americans to get covered under Medicaid for the   first time
T17	Credit_Claiming 3518 3637	So in Oregon, for example, thats helped cut the number of   uninsured people by 10 percent just in the last three weeks
T18	Credit_Claiming 3659 3712	Thats 56,000 more Americans who now have health care.
T19	Credit_Claiming 4093 4297	Thats when we opened the new   marketplaces where people without health insurance, or who cant afford   health insurance, or who arent part of a group plan, can finally start   getting affordable coverage
T20	Credit_Claiming 4323 4640	By   enrolling in what were calling these marketplaces, you become part of a   big group plan -- as if you were working for a big employer -- a   statewide group plan that spreads risk between sick people and healthy   people, between young and old, and then bargains on your behalf for the   best deal on health care
T21	Credit_Claiming 4642 4732	What weve done is essentially create a   competition where there wasnt competition before.
T22	Credit_Claiming 4733 4835	We created these big   group plans, and now insurers are really interested in getting your   business.
T23	Credit_Claiming 4836 4954	And so insurers have created new health care plans with more   choices to be made available through these marketplaces
T24	Credit_Claiming 4956 5032	And as a result of this   choice and this competition, prices have come down
T25	Credit_Claiming 5034 5161	When you add the   new tax credits that many people are eligible for through the law, then   the prices come down even further.
T26	Credit_Claiming 5162 5346	So one study shows that through new   options created by the Affordable Care Act, nearly 6 in 10 uninsured   Americans will find that they can get covered for less than $100 a   month.
T27	Credit_Claiming 5365 5520	Through the marketplaces,   you can get health insurance for what may be the equivalent of your cell   phone bill or your cable bill, and thats a good deal
T28	Credit_Claiming 5522 5661	So the fact is the product   of the Affordable Care Act for people without health insurance is   quality health insurance thats affordable.
T29	Credit_Claiming 5662 5691	And that product is   working
T30	Credit_Claiming 5693 5708	Its really good
T31	Credit_Claiming 5710 5759	And it turns out theres a massive demand   for it
T32	Credit_Claiming 5761 5850	So far, the national website, HealthCare.gov, has been visited   nearly 20 million times.
T33	Credit_Claiming 5851 6003	Twenty million times.And   theres great demand at the state level as well, because there are a   bunch of states that are running their own marketplaces
T34	Credit_Claiming 6768 6788	The product is good.
T35	Credit_Claiming 6789 6841	The health insurance thats being provided is   good.
T36	Credit_Claiming 1148 1232	Despite all that, thousands   of people are signing up and saving money as we speak.
T37	Credit_Claiming 2064 2091	You've already got coverage
T38	Credit_Claiming 6128 6324	They understand that they can get a   good deal at low costs, have the security of health care, and this is   not just for old folks like me -- that everybody needs good quality   health insurance
T39	Credit_Claiming 6326 6477	And all told, more than half a million consumers   across the country have successfully submitted applications through   federal and state marketplaces
T40	Credit_Claiming 6479 6570	And many of those applications arent   just for individuals, its for their entire families.
T41	Credit_Claiming 6571 6738	So even more   people are already looking to potentially take advantage of the high   quality, affordable insurance that is provided through the Affordable   Care Act.
T42	Credit_Claiming 6842 6878	Its high quality and its affordable.
T43	Credit_Claiming 6879 6994	People can save money,   significant money, by getting insurance thats being provided through   these marketplaces.
T44	Credit_Claiming 6995 7031	And we know that the demand is there
T45	Testimonial 571 780	And Im joined today by folks who have   either benefited from the Affordable Care Act already, or who are   helping their fellow citizens learn about what this law means for them   and how they can get covered
T46	Testimonial 1233 1373	Many Americans   with a preexisting condition, like Janice, are discovering that they can   finally get health insurance like everybody else
T47	Testimonial 2317 2535	For example, because of the   Affordable Care Act, young people like Jasmine Jennings, and Jessica   Ugalde, and Ezra Salop, all of whom are here today, theyve been able to   stay on their parents plans until theyre 26
T48	Credit_Claiming 7033 7077	People are   rushing to see whats available.
T49	Credit_Claiming 7078 7159	And those who have already had a   chance to enroll are thrilled with the result.
T50	Emotional_Anecdotes 7160 7371	Every day, people who   were stuck with sky-high premiums because of preexisting conditions are   getting affordable insurance for the first time, or finding, like Janice   did, that theyre saving a lot of money

T54	Credit_Claiming 7490 7631	Every day, people are discovering that new   health insurance plans have to cover maternity care, mental health care,   free preventive care.
T55	Emotional_Anecdotes 7632 7701	So you just heard Janices   story -- she owns her own small business.
T56	Testimonial 7632 7700	So you just heard Janices   story -- she owns her own small business
T57	Emotional_Anecdotes 7702 7788	She recently became the first   woman to enroll in coverage through Delawares exchange
T58	Credit_Claiming 7790 7939	And its true,   it took her a few tries, but it was worth it after being turned down for   insurance three times due to minor preexisting conditions.
T59	Credit_Claiming 7940 8117	So now   shell be covered, shell save 150 bucks a month, and she wont have to   worry that one illness or accident will cost her her business that shes   worked so hard to build

T64	Testimonial 8144 8231	I   recently received a letter from a woman named Jessica Sanford in   Washington State
T65	Emotional_Anecdotes 8233 8380	And heres what she wrote: I am a single mom, no   child support, self-employed, and I havent had insurance for 15 years   because its too expensive
T66	Emotional_Anecdotes 8382 8473	My son has ADHD and requires regular doctor   visits and his meds alone cost $250 per month
T67	Emotional_Anecdotes 8475 8566	I have had an ongoing   tendinitis problem due to my line of work that I havent had treated
T68	Emotional_Anecdotes 8570 8647	Now, finally, we get to have coverage because of the ACA for $169 per   month
T69	Emotional_Anecdotes 8649 8693	I was crying the other day when I signed up.
T70	Emotional_Anecdotes 8694 8717	So much stress   lifted
T71	Credit_Claiming 8833 8880	Thats what the Affordable Care Act is all about
T72	Credit_Claiming 8882 8996	The point   is, the essence of the law -- the health insurance thats available to   people -- is working just fine
T73	Credit_Claiming 8998 9135	In some cases, actually, its exceeding   expectations -- the prices are lower than we expected, the choice is   greater than we expected.
T74	Name_Calling 9334 9429	The website has been too slow, people   have been getting stuck during the application process.
T75	Credit_Claiming 10054 10256	And although many of these folks   have found that they had to wait longer than they wanted, once they   complete the process theyre very happy with the deal thats available   to them, just like Janices

T91	Repetition 10909 11071	So everybody who wants insurance through the marketplace will   get insurance, period. Everybody who wants insurance   through the marketplace will get insurance.
T92	Credit_Claiming 11072 11176	Third, we are doing   everything we can possibly do to get the websites working better,   faster, sooner
T93	Credit_Claiming 11178 11262	Weve got people working overtime, 24/7, to boost   capacity and address the problems
T94	Credit_Claiming 11264 11412	Experts from some of Americas top   private-sector tech companies who, by the way, have seen things like   this happen before, they want it to work.
T95	Credit_Claiming 11413 11434	They're reaching out.
T96	Credit_Claiming 11468 11541	Weve had some of the best IT talent in   the entire country join the team
T97	Credit_Claiming 11543 11595	And were well into a tech surge to   fix the problem
T98	Credit_Claiming 11827 12128	Even   as we redouble our efforts to get the site working as well as its   supposed to, were also redoubling our efforts to make sure you can   still buy the same quality, affordable insurance plans available on the   marketplace the old-fashioned way -- offline, either over the phone or   in person.
T99	Credit_Claiming 12427 12607	Yesterday, we updated the   websites home page to offer more information about the other avenues to   enroll in affordable health care until the online option works for   everybody
T100	Credit_Claiming 12609 12789	So youll find information about how to talk to a specialist   who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable   application you can fill out yourself and mail in
T101	Credit_Claiming 12791 12889	Weve also added more staff   to the call centers where you can apply for insurance over the phone.
T102	Credit_Claiming 12892 12933	Those are already -- they've been working
T103	Credit_Claiming 12998 13063	But keep in mind, these call   centers are already up and running
T104	Credit_Claiming 13065 13166	And you can get your questions   answered by real people, 24 hours a day, in 150 different languages.
T105	Credit_Claiming 13271 13483	Wait times have averaged less than one   minute so far on the call centers, although I admit that the wait times   probably might go up a little bit now that I've read the number out loud   on national television
T106	Repetition 13169 13270	The phone number for these call centers is 1-800-318-2596. I want to   repeat that -- 1-800-318-2596.
T107	Credit_Claiming 13485 13534	But the point is the call   centers are available
T108	Credit_Claiming 13536 13625	You can talk to somebody directly and they can   walk you through the application process
T109	Credit_Claiming 13627 13842	And I guarantee you, if one   thing is worth the wait, its the safety and security of health care   that you can afford, or the amount of money that you can save by buying   health insurance through the marketplaces
T110	Credit_Claiming 13844 14009	Once you get on the phone   with a trained representative, it usually takes about 25 minutes for an   individual to apply for coverage, about 45 minutes for a family
T111	Credit_Claiming 14011 14117	Once   you apply for coverage, you will be contacted by email or postal mail   about your coverage status.
T112	Credit_Claiming 14169 14407	You can also apply in person with the help of   local navigators - these are people specially trained to help you sign   up for health care, and they exist all across the country, or you can go   to community health centers and hospitals.
T113	Credit_Claiming 14408 14529	Just visit   LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov to find out where in your area you can get help   and apply for insurance in person
T115	Credit_Claiming 14919 14961	The product, the health insurance is good.

T117	Credit_Claiming 14983 15002	It is   a good deal
T118	Credit_Claiming 15004 15057	People dont just want it; theyre showing up to buy it
T119	Credit_Claiming 15274 15435	So dont let   problems with the website deter you from signing up, or signing your   family up, or showing your friends how to sign up, because it is worth   it.
T122	Credit_Claiming 15619 15822	In fact, even with the   website issues, weve actually made the overall process of buying   insurance through the marketplace a lot smoother and easier than the old   way of buying insurance on your own.
T123	Name_Calling 15991 16022	absurdly long application forms
T124	Name_Calling 16024 16098	Theres no medical   history questionnaire that goes on for pages and pages
T125	Credit_Claiming 15947 16022	The way weve set it up,   there are no more absurdly long application forms
T126	Credit_Claiming 16024 16098	Theres no medical   history questionnaire that goes on for pages and pages
T127	Credit_Claiming 16100 16173	Theres no more   getting denied because youve had a preexisting condition
T128	Credit_Claiming 16175 16462	Instead of   contacting a bunch of different insurers one at a time, which is what   Janice and a lot of people who are shopping on the individual market for   health insurance had to do, theres one single place you can go shop and   compare plans that have to compete for your business.

T130	Credit_Claiming 16463 16518	Theres one   single phone number you can call for help.
T133	Name_Calling 17060 17185	In fact,   they were willing to shut down the government and potentially harm the   global economy to try to get it repealed.
T134	Credit_Claiming 17525 17636	But I just want to remind   everybody, we did not wage this long and contentious battle just around   a website
T135	Credit_Claiming 17669 17873	We waged this   battle to make sure that millions of Americans in the wealthiest nation   on Earth finally have the same chance to get the same security of   affordable quality health care as anybody else
T136	Patriotism 17669 17874	We waged this   battle to make sure that millions of Americans in the wealthiest nation   on Earth finally have the same chance to get the same security of   affordable quality health care as anybody else.
T137	Credit_Claiming 17903 17945	And the Affordable Care Act has done that.
T138	Credit_Claiming 17946 17981	People can now get good   insurance
T139	Credit_Claiming 17983 18045	People with preexisting conditions can now afford   insurance.
T140	Credit_Claiming 18046 18190	And if the launch of this website proves anything, its that   people across the country dont just need that security, they want that   security.
T141	Credit_Claiming 18468 18527	And if the product is good, they're willing   to be patient
