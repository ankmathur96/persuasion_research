T98	Glittering_Generalities 13810 13872	That’s our birthright – the capacity to shape our own destiny.
T99	Glittering_Generalities 13874 13970	That’s what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny and our GIs to liberate a continent
T101	Patriotism 14152 14218	America has never been about what one person says he’ll do for us.
T102	Glittering_Generalities 14220 14364	It’s about what can be achieved by us, together, through the hard, slow, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately enduring work of self-government.

T79	Glittering_Generalities 14412 14457	She knows that this is a big, diverse country
T80	Glittering_Generalities 15274 15463	She knows that acknowledging problems that have festered for decades isn’t making race relations worse, it’s creating the possibility for people of good will to join and make things better.
T95	Glittering_Generalities 15976 16025	It can be frustrating, this business of democracy
T100	Fear 16162 16265	Supporters can grow impatient and worry that you’re not trying hard enough, that you’ve maybe sold out.
T103	Glittering_Generalities 16267 16391	But I promise you, when we keep at it, when we change enough minds, when we deliver enough votes, then progress does happen.
T105	Credit_Claiming 16393 16478	And if you doubt that, just ask the 20 million more people who have health care today
T106	Credit_Claiming 16481 16572	Just ask the Marine who proudly serves his country without hiding the husband that he loves
T110	Glittering_Generalities 21216 21443	They knew these values were exactly what drew immigrants here, and they believed that the children of those immigrants were just as American as their own, whether they wore a cowboy hat or a yarmulke, a baseball cap or a hijab.
T122	Patriotism 21216 21442	They knew these values were exactly what drew immigrants here, and they believed that the children of those immigrants were just as American as their own, whether they wore a cowboy hat or a yarmulke, a baseball cap or a hijab
T123	Glittering_Generalities 24239 24432	So many of you who had never been involved in politics, who picked up phones and hit the streets and used the internet in amazing new ways that I didn’t really understand but made change happen
T124	Glittering_Generalities 25428 25465	Thank you for this incredible journey
T30	Glittering_Generalities 2906 2990	For everyone who has not yet felt the progress of these past seven and a half years.
T144	Testimonial 6318 6373	Let me tell you, it was tough because Hillary was tough
T145	Testimonial 6392 6483	She was doing everything I was doing but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels
T151	Testimonial 6485 6572	And every time I thought I might have had the race won, Hillary just came back stronger
T154	Testimonial 6698 6799	But ultimately, she said, “Yes”, because she knew that what was at stake was bigger than either of us
T173	Testimonial 6802 6914	And for four years, for four years, I had a front row seat to her intelligence, her judgment, and her discipline
T184	Testimonial 6917 7066	I came to realize that her unbelievable work ethic wasn’t for praise, it wasn’t for attention, that she was in this for everyone who needs a champion
T185	Testimonial 7069 7161	I understood that after all these years, she has never forgotten just who she’s fighting for
T196	Testimonial 7164 7363	Hillary’s still got the tenacity that she had as a young woman, working at the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door to ultimately make sure kids with disabilities could get a quality education
T199	Testimonial 7366 7544	She still got the heart she showed as our First Lady, working with Congress to help push through a children’s health insurance program that to this day protects millions of kids.
T200	Testimonial 7546 7892	She’s still seared with the memory of every American she met who lost loved ones on 9/11, which is why as a Senator from New York she fought so hard for funding to help first responders, to help the city rebuild, why as Secretary of State she sat with me in the Situation Room and forcefully argued in favor of the mission that took out Bin Laden
T202	Testimonial 8128 8159	But Hillary’s been in the room.
T203	Testimonial 8160 8194	She’s been part of those decisions
T213	Testimonial 8196 8389	She knows what’s at stake in the decisions our government makes, what’s at stake for the working family, for the senior citizens or the small business owners, for the soldiers, for the veteran.
T214	Testimonial 8392 8504	And, even in the midst of crisis, she listens to people and she keeps cool and she treat everybody with respect.
T215	Testimonial 8506 8613	And, no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never ever quits
T216	Testimonial 8615 8642	That is the Hillary I know.
T217	Testimonial 8643 8682	That’s the Hillary I’ve come to admire.
T218	Testimonial 8684 8882	And that’s why I can say with confidence, there has never been a man or a woman – not me, not Bill, nobody – more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America
T219	Testimonial 9061 9155	Tim Kaine is as good a man, as humble and as committed a public servant as anybody that I know
T220	Testimonial 9208 9241	He will be a great vice president
T221	Testimonial 9243 9282	He will make Hillary a better president
T222	Testimonial 9366 9470	Now, come on, Hillary has real plans to address the concerns she’s heard from you on the campaign trail.
T223	Testimonial 9472 9667	She’s got specific ideas to invest in new jobs, to help workers share in their company’s profits, to help put kids in preschool, and put students through college without taking out a ton of debt.
T224	Testimonial 10497 10728	If you want someone with a lifelong track record of fighting for higher wages and better benefits and a fair tax code and a bigger voice for workers and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton.
T225	Testimonial 10869 10965	Hillary Clinton is respected around the world, not just by leaders but by the people they serve.
T226	Testimonial 11094 11144	Because they know Hillary, they’ve seen her worked
T227	Testimonial 11147 11225	She’s worked closely with our intelligence teams, our diplomats, our military.
T228	Testimonial 11226 11319	She has the judgment and the experience and the temperament to meet the threat from terrorism
T229	Testimonial 11432 11488	And I know Hillary won’t relent until ISIL is destroyed.
T230	Testimonial 11489 11614	She will finish the job, and she’ll do it without resorting to torture, or banning entire religions from entering our country
T231	Testimonial 11617 11678	She is fit and she is ready to be the next commander-in-chief
T232	Testimonial 14366 14410	And that’s what Hillary Clinton understands.
T233	Testimonial 14412 14458	She knows that this is a big, diverse country.
T234	Testimonial 14459 14475	She has seen it.
T235	Testimonial 14476 14491	She’s traveled.
T236	Testimonial 14492 14513	She’s talked to folks
T237	Testimonial 14516 14580	And she understands that most issues are rarely black and white.
T238	Testimonial 14581 14737	She understands that even when you’re 100% right, getting things done requires compromise, that democracy doesn’t work if we constantly demonize each other.
T239	Testimonial 14739 14954	She knows that for progress to happen, we have to listen to each other and see ourselves in each other and fight for our principles but also fight to find common ground, no matter how elusive that may sometimes seem
T240	Testimonial 14957 15256	Hillary knows we can work through racial divides in this country when we realize the worry black parents feel when their son leaves the house isn’t so different than what a brave cop’s family feels when he puts on the blue and goes to work, that we can honor police and treat every community fairly.
T241	Testimonial 15274 15462	She knows that acknowledging problems that have festered for decades isn’t making race relations worse, it’s creating the possibility for people of good will to join and make things better
T242	Testimonial 15465 15643	Hillary knows we can insist on a lawful and orderly immigration system while still seeing striving students and their toiling parents as loving families, not criminals or rapists
T243	Testimonial 15820 15933	She knows their dream is quintessentially American, and the American dream is something no wall will ever contain
T244	Testimonial 15935 15974	This are the things that Hillary knows.
T245	Testimonial 16045 16063	Hillary knows, too
T246	Testimonial 18618 18661	Hillary Clinton is that woman in the arena.
T247	Testimonial 18195 18260	She knows that sometimes during that 40 years she’s made mistakes
T248	Testimonial 18663 18721	She’s been there for us even if we haven’t always noticed.
T186	Glittering_Generalities 24693 24821	I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me because you’re who I was talking about 12 years ago when I talked about hope.
T249	Testimonial 24623 24692	And tonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me.
