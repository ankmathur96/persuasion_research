T1	Fear 162 174	We're at war
T2	Fear 175 236	Our economy has lost 7 million jobs over the last   two years
T3	Fear 237 335	And our government is deeply in debt after what can only be   described as a decade of profligacy.
T4	Fear 477 784	Yet over the course of the   past 10 years, the previous administration and previous Congresses   created an expensive new drug program, passed massive tax cuts for the   wealthy, and funded two wars without paying for any of it -- all of   which was compounded by recession and by rising health care costs.
T6	Fear 1049 1218	But one year ago, our country was in crisis:We   were losing nearly 700,000 jobs each month, the economy was in a free   fall, and the financial system was near collapse
T7	Fear 1219 1257	Many feared another   Great Depression
T8	Fear 1557 1714	And that includes the failure to rein in spending, as   well a reliance on borrowing -- from Wall Street to Washington to Main   Street -- to fuel our growth
T9	Glittering_Generalities 2057 2125	We will continue, for example, to do   what it takes to create jobs.
T10	Glittering_Generalities 2428 2517	We also continue to lay a   new foundation for lasting growth, which is essential as well
T11	Name_Calling 312 335	a decade of profligacy.
T12	Fear 2519 2768	Just as   it would be a terrible mistake to borrow against our children's future   to pay our way today, it would be equally wrong to neglect their future   by failing to invest in areas that will determine our economic success   in this new century
T17	Credit_Claiming 1369 1452	One year later, because of   the steps we've taken, we're in a very different place
T18	Stereotyping 1745 1855	We have to   do what families across America are doing:Save where we can so that we   can afford what we need.
T19	Name_Calling 1519 1539	the irresponsibility
T20	Patriotism 1745 1855	We have to   do what families across America are doing:Save where we can so that we   can afford what we need.
T21	Credit_Claiming 2770 2989	That's why we build on the   largest investment in clean energy in history, as well as increase   investment in scientific research, so that we are fostering the   industries and jobs of the future right here in America
T24	Credit_Claiming 3824 4011	And in   a departure from the way business had been done in Washington, we   actually show how we pay for these investments while putting our country   on a more fiscally sustainable path
T29	Credit_Claiming 4460 4630	We have gone through every   department's spending line by line, item by item, looking for   inefficiency, duplication, and programs that have outlived their   usefulness
T35	Credit_Claiming 4676 4717	Last year, we   found $17 billion in cuts
T36	Credit_Claiming 4718 4760	This year, we've already found $20 billion
T45	Credit_Claiming 6304 6452	And last fall, we   launched the "SAVE Awards" to solicit ideas from federal employees about   how make government more efficient and more effective
T54	Fear 8884 9175	But   the bottom line is this:We simply cannot continue to spend as if   deficits don't have consequences; as if waste doesn't matter; as if the   hard-earned tax dollars of the American people can be treated like   Monopoly money; as if we can ignore this challenge for another   generation
T55	Fear 9176 9184	We can't
T56	Name_Calling 9272 9444	What I   will not welcome -- what I reject -- is the same old grandstanding when   the cameras are on, and the same irresponsible budget policies when the   cameras are off
T57	Stereotyping 9445 9536	It's time to hold Washington to the same standards   families and businesses hold themselve
T58	Glittering_Generalities 9538 9627	It's time to save what we can,   spend what we must, and live within our means once again
T59	Credit_Claiming 26 89	This morning, I sent a budget to Congress for the coming   year
T5	Fear 784 935	As a   result, when I first walked through the door, the deficit stood at $1.3   trillion, with projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.
T61	Name_Calling 477 783	Yet over the course of the   past 10 years, the previous administration and previous Congresses   created an expensive new drug program, passed massive tax cuts for the   wealthy, and funded two wars without paying for any of it -- all of   which was compounded by recession and by rising health care costs
T32	Credit_Claiming 1258 1368	So we initiated a rescue, and that rescue was not   without significant cost; it added to the deficit as well.
T13	Glittering_Generalities 2770 2990	That's why we build on the   largest investment in clean energy in history, as well as increase   investment in scientific research, so that we are fostering the   industries and jobs of the future right here in America.
T14	Glittering_Generalities 3729 3823	These are the investments we   must make to create jobs and opportunity now and in the future.
T15	Glittering_Generalities 6109 6233	Like any business, we're also looking for ways to get more bang for our   buck, by promoting innovation and cutting red tape
T16	Name_Calling 7197 7225	It's waste, pure and simple.
