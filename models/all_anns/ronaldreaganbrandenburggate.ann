T19	Credit_Claiming 459 560	We come to Berlin, we American Presidents, because it's our duty to   speak in this place of freedom.
T23	Glittering_Generalities 3992 4053	A strong, free   world in the West -- that dream became real.
T24	Glittering_Generalities 4346 4621	Adenauer,   Erhard, Reuter, and other leaders understood the practical importance of liberty   -- that just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of   speech, so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessman enjoy   economic freedom
T25	Repetition 4623 4663	The German leaders -- the German leaders

T28	Credit_Claiming 4805 5034	Where four decades ago there was   rubble, today in West Berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city   in Germany: busy office blocks, fine homes and apartments, proud avenues, and   the spreading lawns of parkland

T64	Name_Calling 8288 8353	For many months, the   Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness.

T72	Credit_Claiming 9541 9838	And in cooperation with many of   our allies, the United States is pursuing the Strategic Defense Initiative --   research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation, but on   defenses that truly defend; on systems, in short, that will not target   populations, but shield them.
T78	Glittering_Generalities 10336 10383	And freedom itself is transforming the   globe.

T90	Glittering_Generalities 11203 11306	And surely there is no better place than Berlin, the meeting place of   East and West, to make a start.
T92	Glittering_Generalities 11485 11638	Let us use this   occasion, the 750th anniversary of this city, to usher in a new era, to seek a   still fuller, richer life for the Berlin of the future
T95	Repetition 12368 12380	With -- With
T103	Glittering_Generalities 13954 14042	Certainly there's a great deal to be said for your   fortitude, for your defiant courage
T104	Glittering_Generalities 14044 14178	But I believe there's something deeper,   something that involves Berlin's whole look and feel and way of life -- not mere   sentiment
T105	Glittering_Generalities 14264 14646	Something, instead, that has seen the difficulties of life in   Berlin but chose to accept them, that continues to build this good and proud   city in contrast to a surrounding totalitarian presence, that refuses to release   human energies or aspirations, something that speaks with a powerful voice of   affirmation, that says "yes" to this city, yes to the future, yes to freedom
T106	Name_Calling 14427 14462	a surrounding totalitarian presence
T107	Glittering_Generalities 14648 14751	In   a word, I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin -- is "love." Love both profound and abiding.
T108	Glittering_Generalities 14754 14866	Perhaps this gets to the root of   the matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all between East and West.
T109	Name_Calling 14869 15021	The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to   the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship.
T112	Name_Calling 15022 15099	The   totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront
T114	Emotional_Anecdotes 15102 15247	Years ago, before the East Germans   began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure: the   television tower at Alexander Platz
T115	Emotional_Anecdotes 15249 15443	Virtually ever since, the authorities have   been working to correct what they view as the tower's one major flaw: treating   the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind.
T116	Emotional_Anecdotes 15444 15576	Yet even   today when the sun strikes that sphere, that sphere that towers over all Berlin,   the light makes the sign of the cross.
T117	Glittering_Generalities 15577 15675	There in Berlin, like the city itself,   symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed
T118	Emotional_Anecdotes 15677 15874	As I looked out a moment ago from   the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely   spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner (quote): "This wall will fall.
T119	Glittering_Generalities 15877 16002	Beliefs become reality." Yes, across Europe, this wall will   fall, for it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth.
T120	Glittering_Generalities 16003 16038	The wall   cannot withstand freedom
T121	Fear 16279 16454	I wonder if they have ever asked   themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek,   no one would ever be able to do what they're doing again.
T122	Glittering_Generalities 16455 16487	Thank you and God bless you all.
T123	Patriotism 459 559	We come to Berlin, we American Presidents, because it's our duty to   speak in this place of freedom
T2	Glittering_Generalities 561 817	But I must confess, were drawn here   by other things as well; by the feeling of history in this city --   more than 500 years older than our own nation; by the beauty of the   Grunewald and the Tiergarten; most of all, by your courage and   determination.
T3	Glittering_Generalities 1233 1352	To those  listening throughout Eastern Europe, I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the  American people.
T4	Glittering_Generalities 2575 2904	President Von   Weizscker has said,   "The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed." Well   today -- today I say: As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a   wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains   open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.
T10	Glittering_Generalities 2942 3037	For I find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this wall, a   message of triumph
T11	Patriotism 3156 3232	Thousands of miles away, the people of the United States reached out to help
T12	Glittering_Generalities 3902 3991	The sign read simply: "The   Marshall Plan is helping here to strengthen the free world."
T14	Credit_Claiming 3992 4053	A strong, free   world in the West -- that dream became real.
T15	Credit_Claiming 4054 4104	Japan rose from ruin to become an   economic giant
T20	Credit_Claiming 4106 4246	Italy, France, Belgium -- virtually every nation in Western   Europe saw political and economic rebirth; the European Community was founded.
T21	Credit_Claiming 4247 4345	In West Germany and here in   Berlin, there took place an economic miracle, the Wirtschaftswunder.
T22	Glittering_Generalities 5192 5307	Where there was want, today there's abundance   -- food, clothing, automobiles -- the wonderful goods of the Kudamm
T31	Glittering_Generalities 5311 5450	From   devastation, from utter ruin, you Berliners have, in freedom, rebuilt a city   that once again ranks as one of the greatest on earth
T32	Glittering_Generalities 6115 6254	After these four decades, then, there stands before   the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to   prosperity.
T40	Glittering_Generalities 6255 6334	Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity   and peace.
T41	Glittering_Generalities 6358 6472	And now -- now the Soviets   themselves may, in a limited way, be coming to understand the importance of   freedom
T42	Glittering_Generalities 6474 6540	We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness
T43	Glittering_Generalities 6751 6818	Are   these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state?
T46	Glittering_Generalities 7153 7287	There is one sign the Soviets can   make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of   freedom and peace.
T47	Glittering_Generalities 7765 7821	So, we must maintain defenses of unassailable   strength
T48	Glittering_Generalities 7823 7888	Yet we seek peace; so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides
T49	Credit_Claiming 8091 8287	The Western alliance responded by committing itself to a   counter-deployment (unless the Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution) --   namely, the elimination of such weapons on both sides.
T52	Credit_Claiming 8624 8786	And I invite those who protested then -- I invite those who protest   today -- to mark this fact: Because we remained strong, the Soviets came back to   the table
T60	Glittering_Generalities 9839 9915	By these means we seek to increase the safety of   Europe and all the world.
T61	Glittering_Generalities 10065 10125	And our differences are not about weapons but about liberty.
T63	Glittering_Generalities 10126 10243	When  President Kennedy   spoke at the City Hall those 24 years ago, freedom was encircled;   Berlin was under siege.
T67	Glittering_Generalities 10244 10335	And today, despite all the pressures upon this city,   Berlin stands secure in its liberty.
T68	Glittering_Generalities 10472 10564	Throughout the Pacific,   free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth.
T69	Glittering_Generalities 10384 10471	In the Philippines, in South and   Central America, democracy has been given a rebirth.
T70	Glittering_Generalities 10731 10820	n Europe, only one nation and   those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom
T71	Glittering_Generalities 10822 10996	Yet in this age of   redoubled economic growth, of information and innovation, the Soviet Union faces   a choice: It must make fundamental changes, or it will become obsolete
T73	Glittering_Generalities 11308 11483	Free people of Berlin: Today, as   in the past, the United States stands for the strict observance and full   implementation of all parts of the   Four Power Agreement of 1971
T74	Glittering_Generalities 11798 12037	And I invite Mr. Gorbachev: Let us   work to bring the Eastern and Western parts of the city closer together, so that   all the inhabitants of all Berlin can enjoy the benefits that come with life in   one of the great cities of the world.
T75	Glittering_Generalities 12517 12717	It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of   United Nations meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms control,   or other issues that call for international cooperation.
T76	Glittering_Generalities 12718 12940	There is no better way to   establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds, and we would be   honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges, cultural events, and other programs   for young Berliners from the East.
T77	Glittering_Generalities 13132 13390	One final proposal, one close to   my heart: Sport represents a source of enjoyment and ennoblement, and you may   have noted that the Republic of Korea -- South Korea -- has offered to permit   certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place in the North.
T79	Glittering_Generalities 13487 13655	And what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than   to offer in some future year to hold the Olympic games here in Berlin, East and   West.
T80	Fear 13736 13833	You've done so in spite of threats   -- the Soviet attempts to impose the East-mark, the blockade
T83	Glittering_Generalities 14869 15020	The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to   the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship
