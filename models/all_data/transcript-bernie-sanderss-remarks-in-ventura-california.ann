T16	Fear 1456 1651	And what a rigged economy is is that for 30 years the middle class of this country has been shrinking, shrinking, and shrinking, and almost all new income and wealth today is going to the top 1%.
T17	Fear 1653 1760	What a rigged economy is about the top 0.1% – not 1%, 0.1% – owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%
T20	Fear 1763 1905	The rigged economy is when the 20 wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans – half of our people
T21	Fear 1908 2037	A rigged economy is when one family – the Walton family of Walmart – owns more wealth than the bottom 42% of the American people.
T22	Fear 2141 2302	Walmart, owned by the wealthiest family in America, pays wages that are so low that many of the people who work there have got to go on food stamps and Medicaid.
T23	Fear 2349 2487	That’s right – working families of this country pay higher taxes in order to subsidize the wages paid by the wealthiest family in America.
T19	Fear 2590 2764	But it is not just a corrupt campaign finance system, it’s not just a rigged economy where today here in California, my state of Vermont, people are working two or three jobs
T24	Fear 2841 2912	And at the end of all of that, 58% of all new income goes to the top 1%
T25	Fear 3217 3330	Every American should be embarrassed by the fact that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth
T27	Fear 3669 3884	And one of the reasons that we have so many people in jail is that across this country in inner cities, in African-American and Latino neighborhoods, in rural areas, we have youth unemployment rates of 30%, 40%, 50%
T28	Fear 3887 3943	Kids get out of high school, there are no jobs for them.

T32	Fear 5133 5293	We have got to change law enforcement culture in this country so that the use of lethal force – shooting somebody – is the last response, not the first response

T38	Fear 5634 5776	Your employer asks you, “Hey, young man, you ever have a police record?” “Yes, sir, I did.” “Well, I got somebody else interested in that job.
T39	Fear 5780 5847	A lot of lives have been ruined because of possession of marijuana.
T42	Fear 7199 7343	Right now, in my state, in New England, and I believe all over this country, we’re looking at a horrific epidemic of opiate and heroin addiction
T43	Fear 7345 7359	It is terrible
T44	Fear 7362 7467	And what we are seeing every single day is people are overdosing on opiates or heroin and they are dying.
T45	Fear 7838 7996	Right now, there are people who are addicted, who are strung out, who would like to get help but there is no treatment available for them that they can afford
T46	Fear 7999 8200	And in addition to that what is true – although what is very scary – is that walking the streets of America today right now, you’ve got many thousands of people who are suicidal and some are homicidal.
T47	Fear 8201 8268	And we all know about the terrible mass shootings that we have seen
T48	Fear 8483 8665	And what working people are telling me is they can’t make it on $9, $10, or $11 an hour, which is why in my view we’re going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage – $15 an hour.
T63	Fear 9589 9932	And what young people are asking me – they’re asking me a very simple but very important question and that is how is it that when they do exactly the right thing, when they go out and get the best education that they can, which is what we want all Americans to be able to do, why is it that they’re ending up $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 in debt?
T64	Fear 10507 10581	But the world, the economy, technology have changed over the last 40 years
T65	Fear 10583 10691	And today in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent to what a high school degree was 40 years ago
T66	Fear 10694 10843	And that is why I believe that today when we talk about public education, it is not good enough to be talking about first grade through twelfth grade
T67	Fear 11399 11450	How many people here are dealing with student debt?
T71	Fear 11507 11593	We’re talking about millions of people…What I’m hearing is $100,000, $220,000, $80,000
T72	Glittering_Generalities 11621 11770	What this campaign is trying to do is to get people to think outside of the box, to think outside of the options that corporate media often gives us.
T62	Plain_Folks 9990 10022	My parents never went to college
T61	Plain_Folks 9934 9989	I grew up in a family that did not have a lot of money.
T73	Fear 11902 11969	Why in God’s name are we punishing people for getting an education?
T74	Fear 11970 12017	We should be rewarding them, not punishing them
T75	Name_Calling 12557 12769	Eight years ago, after the greed, the recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street helped bring this country into the worst economic recession since the 1930s, Congress against my vote bailed out Wall Street
T76	Glittering_Generalities 12900 13006	This country bailed out Wall Street; now it is Wall Street’s time to help the middle class of this country
T77	Glittering_Generalities 13135 13229	This campaign is listening to people and communities whose voices and pain are not often heard
T78	Fear 13274 13331	There are 11 million undocumented people in this country.
T79	Fear 13332 13382	Many of them are living in the shadows and in fear
T80	Fear 13384 13553	Many of them who are at work right now are being exploited because when you have no legal rights, you can’t stand up to a boss who exploits you and cheats you on the job
T84	Fear 14044 14338	And what the African-American community is asking me absolutely correctly how does it happen that we could spend trillions of dollars on a war in Iraq that we never should have gotten into and yet supposedly we don’t have the money to rebuild our crumbling inner cities throughout this country?
T85	Fear 14414 14560	I was in Flint, Michigan where children were poisoned because of lead in the water in a water system that was to say the least totally inadequate.
T86	Fear 14562 14676	I was in Detroit, Michigan where the school system – the public school system – is on the verge of fiscal collapse
T87	Fear 14679 14829	I was in Baltimore, Maryland where tens of thousands of people are addicted to heroin and can’t get the treatment that they need to get off of heroin.
T88	Glittering_Generalities 14831 14961	In my view, instead of rebuilding communities in Afghanistan, we should be rebuilding communities in the United States of America.
T89	Fear 14963 15101	This campaign is listening to a people who are in real pain but that pain is almost never heard and that is the Native American community.
T90	Fear 15103 15162	All of us know that the Native American people were lied to
T91	Fear 15164 15181	They were cheated
T92	Fear 15183 15252	And treaties they negotiated throughout our history have been broken.
T93	Glittering_Generalities 15254 15360	The Native American people have given us so much that we have a debt owed to them that we can never repay.
T94	Fear 15362 15503	And maybe the most important lesson that they have taught us – an incredibly profound lesson – is that as human beings we are part of nature.
T95	Fear 15530 15620	And if we continue to destroy nature, what we are doing is ultimately destroying ourselves
T96	Fear 15623 15773	But despite all that the Native Americans have given us, in Native American communities throughout this country, poverty and unemployment are sky high
T97	Fear 15775 15835	Health care and education is not of the quality it should be
T98	Fear 15999 16414	And let me tell you that I have listened and talked to scientists all over our country and all over the world and they are virtually unanimous in telling us what people like Donald Trump and other Republicans refuse to acknowledge and that is climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and as the people of California already know, it is causing devastating problems in our country and around the world
T99	Fear 16418 16653	And what the scientists also tell us if we do not get our act together now, a bad situation will become much worse – more drought, more floods, more extreme weather disturbances, more acidification of the ocean, more rising sea levels.
T100	Glittering_Generalities 16655 16732	We have a moral obligation as custodians of this planet – that is what we are
T101	Glittering_Generalities 16754 16777	We are custodians of it
T102	Fear 17110 17345	And one important question is how does it happen that in our great country – the wealthiest country in the history of the world, how does it happen that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people?
T103	Fear 17382 17434	How many people here today have no health insurance?
T104	Fear 17435 17450	Raise your hand
T105	Fear 17452 17543	How many people her have high deductibles and high co-payments in their insurance policies?

T108	Fear 17545 17606	All right, what you are seeing is a failed health care system
T109	Fear 17660 17687	But it has not done enough…
T110	Fear 17846 17983	We are losing thousands of people every single year who by the time they get into a doctor’s office, their situation has become terminal.
T111	Name_Calling 17984 18005	That is unacceptable.
T112	Fear 18007 18201	Furthermore, not only today do we have so many people uninsured – 29 million -and more under-insured, every one of us is getting ripped by the unconscionable greed of the pharmaceutical industry
T113	Name_Calling 18146 18201	the unconscionable greed of the pharmaceutical industry
T114	Fear 18204 18396	There are people in America dying and there are people getting much sicker than they should because they cannot afford the astronomical high prices that the drug industry is charging us today.
T115	Fear 18398 18572	It is crazy that one out of four Americans cannot afford the medicine they need and it is equally crazy that the top five drug companies last year made $50 billion in profit.
T116	Fear 18575 18671	f elected president, the drug companies will not continue ripping off the people of this country

T124	Name_Calling 21570 21586	starvation wages
T128	Fear 22240 22414	And what I am seeing all over this country literally from coast to coast, from Maine to California is people are beginning to understand that something is fundamentally wrong
T129	Fear 22416 22560	They are asking themselves why is it that I am working longer hours for lower wages and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1%?
T130	Fear 22562 22711	Why is it that we’re seeing a proliferation of billionaires and yet half of the children in America in public schools are on free or reduced lunches?
T131	Fear 22713 22780	Why is it that kids are graduating schools $90,000 or more in debt?
T132	Fear 22782 22853	Why is it that women are making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men?
T133	Fear 22855 22962	Why is it that we are the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid family and medical leave?
T134	Name_Calling 22964 23047	Why are we the only country – major country – not to guarantee health care for all?
T135	Fear 23049 23174	Why is our infrastructure – our roads, our bridges – collapsing at the same time as millions of people desperately need jobs?
T136	Fear 23176 23261	Why are we firing teachers when we need more teachers to better educate our children?
T138	Fear 23374 23443	Why do we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
T139	Fear 23444 23522	Why does Wall Street continue to rip off the American people every single day?
T140	Glittering_Generalities 23595 23956	And the answer is that when people come together by the millions, when people stand up and say that our government has got to represent all of us, not just the few, when this country brings about a political revolution so that real power rests in the hands of working families not wealthy campaign contributors, that’s when we bring real change to this country.
T143	Stereotyping 4559 4669	And the overwhelming majority of police officers are honest, hardworking, and have a very difficult job to do.
T144	Fear 22048 22136	No, my Republican friends think we have to cut Social Security and benefits for veterans
T1	Glittering_Generalities 485 578	What the American people understand is that we have got to bring forth a political revolution
T142	Glittering_Generalities 896 1032	And here is the truth that in our great nation today we have a corrupt campaign finance system, which is undermining American democracy.
T51	Emotional_Anecdotes 2766 2789	Mom’s working 40 hours.

T14	Glittering_Generalities 8950 9099	This campaign is also listening to women who are hearing Republicans all over this country – Donald Trump and others – who are touting family values.
T26	Glittering_Generalities 9100 9148	And you all know what they mean by family values
T34	Glittering_Generalities 9275 9441	And by the way, when Republicans talk about family values what they are also saying to our gay brothers and sisters that they should not have the right to get married
T40	Stereotyping 14044 14338	And what the African-American community is asking me absolutely correctly how does it happen that we could spend trillions of dollars on a war in Iraq that we never should have gotten into and yet supposedly we don’t have the money to rebuild our crumbling inner cities throughout this country?

T49	Glittering_Generalities 18937 19048	It always occurs throughout our history when people by the millions stand up and fight back and demand dignity.
T50	Glittering_Generalities 19423 19439	We want dignity.
T52	Glittering_Generalities 21773 21978	My point is that the establishment always wants you to believe that real change is impossible, that your dreams are so radical they cannot be achieved and you’ve got to accept minor, minor changes at best.
