T26	Credit_Claiming 3422 3630	I was proud to be the first U.S.   President to meet with the leaders of all 10 ASEAN countries --   the first U.S. President to attend the East Asia Summit,   and this visit marks my sixth meeting with ASEAN
T27	Credit_Claiming 3779 3916	Its one of the reasons   that, while Ive been in office, weve boosted our exports across Asia   by more than 50 percent, to record levels
T28	Credit_Claiming 4195 4487	When I became President, I made   a strategic decision that after a decade in which the United States had   focused so heavily elsewhere, especially the wars in Iraq and   Afghanistan, that we would rebalance our foreign policy and play a   larger and long-term role here in the Asia Pacific.
T36	Glittering_Generalities 5024 5243	So I put forward a vision   of the future our nations can build together: A future of mutual   security and peace where international law and norms are upheld and   where disputes are resolved by dialogue and diplomacy.
T37	Glittering_Generalities 5244 5303	A future of open   markets and trade that is free and fair.
T38	Glittering_Generalities 5304 5498	A future of freedom, where   government is based on the will of the people, citizens are empowered by   democratic governance and the inherent dignity and human rights of all   people are upheld

T67	Patriotism 10138 10400	And so, by eliminating some 18,000   tariffs that other countries put on American exports, TPP levels the   playing field for our workers and businesses -- which means American   manufacturers will be able to sell more cars and trucks, equipment and   machinery.
T68	Patriotism 10552 10605	The bottom line is,   Americans are ready to compete.

T73	Glittering_Generalities 11675 11761	TPP is a   long-term investment in our shared security and in universal human   rights
T77	Glittering_Generalities 12957 13171	Theres a virtuous circle --   our alliances are the foundation for our security, which becomes the   foundation of our prosperity, which allows us to invest in the sources   of our strength, including our alliances
T81	Glittering_Generalities 13773 13882	With greater prosperity comes greater responsibility, and both Malaysia   and Vietnam are, indeed, doing more

T84	Glittering_Generalities 14448 14701	We   believe that economic relationships should be based not on one country   simply extracting the resources of another country, but rather, as TPP   envisions, economic partnerships where we encourage innovation and   investment for our mutual benefit
T86	Glittering_Generalities 15209 15380	In this sense, with TPP,   were not only writing the rules for trade in the Asia Pacific, we also   have an historic opportunity to shape the future of the global economy.

T51	Glittering_Generalities 12007 12077	First, TPP will help build greater trust and cooperation among nations
T52	Glittering_Generalities 12632 12741	So TPP will help   to advance the economic integration that underwrites peace and stability   in this region.

T75	Glittering_Generalities 14828 14988	We believe in fair competition -- which   is why TPP is the first trade agreement to level the playing field   between private firms and state-owned enterprises
T76	Glittering_Generalities 14990 15208	And we believe that   citizens should be able to explore new ideas and innovate -- which is   why TPP protects the free flow of data and information across borders   and commits our nations to a free and open Internet.
T61	Glittering_Generalities 9435 9551	And when the high   tariffs among our TPP partners come down also, it will create new   opportunities for everybody.
