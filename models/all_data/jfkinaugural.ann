T3	Fear 596 707	For man holds in his mortal hands  the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.
T4	Glittering_Generalities 708 921	And yet the  same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the  globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but  from the hand of God
T5	Glittering_Generalities 923 995	We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first  revolution
T6	Glittering_Generalities 997 1439	Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that  the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in this century,  tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage,  and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this  nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around  the world.

T8	Glittering_Generalities 1442 1651	Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear  any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival  and the success of liberty

T15	Glittering_Generalities 2825 3050	To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special  pledge: to convert our good words into good deeds, in a new alliance for progress, to  assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty

T20	Name_Calling 3876 3907	the dark powers of  destruction
T21	Fear 3716 3992	Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge  but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of  destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental  self-destruction.
T22	Fear 3995 4031	We dare not tempt them with weakness
T23	Fear 4150 4468	But neither can two great  and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course -- both sides  overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of  the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the  hand of mankind's final war

T43	Patriotism 6166 6524	Now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need -- not  as a call to battle, though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a long  twilight struggle, year in and year out, "rejoicing in hope; patient in   tribulation," a  struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.

T1	Glittering_Generalities 209 428	Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens:   We observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom -- symbolizing an end,  as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal, as well as change.
T12	Glittering_Generalities 1978 2170	To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we  pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be  replaced by a far more iron tyranny
T13	Glittering_Generalities 2234 2430	But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom --  and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of  the tiger ended up inside

T18	Glittering_Generalities 3351 3713	To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our  last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of  peace, we renew our pledge of support -- to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for  invective, to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak, and to enlarge the area in  which its writ may run.
T19	Fear 4784 4998	Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the  inspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations  under the absolute control of all nations.
T27	Fear 5001 5076	Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors
T30	Glittering_Generalities 5368 5620	And, if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides  join in creating a new endeavor -- not a new balance of power, but a new world of law --  where the strong are just, and the weak secure, and the peace preserved.
