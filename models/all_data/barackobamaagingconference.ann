T3	Testimonial 476 596	I want to especially point out one of my favorite former   members of Congress, a legend whos here today -- John Dingell
T4	Testimonial 599 617	John,   thank you.
T5	Testimonial 618 689	John was elected to Congress   when he was just 29 -- an over-achiever.
T7	Credit_Claiming 690 850	Ten years later, he presided   over the House chamber for the vote to pass Medicare into law -- an   achievement for which he and his father can take some credi
T6	Emotional_Anecdotes 853 924	Last   week, John turned 89 -- so we want to wish John a happy birthday
T8	Glittering_Generalities 1214 1418	You understand the whole terrain -- not just the   challenges, but also the opportunities; not only the questions were   asking today but the questions that we have to start thinking about for   tomorrow.
T9	Patriotism 1588 1654	And by that measure,   the United States has a lot to be proud of.
T10	Patriotism 1655 1738	Medicare, Medicaid, Social   Security are some of our greatest triumphs as a nation
T15	Credit_Claiming 2150 2289	And, by the way, since   the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the uninsured rate for all   Americans has fallen by about one-third.
T16	Patriotism 2323 2431	Together we declared that   every citizen of this country deserves a basic measure of security and   dignity
T18	Patriotism 2433 2548	That choice saved millions upon millions of our people from   poverty, allowed them to live longer and better lives
T21	Patriotism 2550 2581	So we got to be   proud of that
T22	Patriotism 2583 2687	These American endeavors didnt just make our country   better, it reaffirmed our greatness as a country.
T23	Glittering_Generalities 2583 2686	These American endeavors didnt just make our country   better, it reaffirmed our greatness as a country

T28	Plain_Folks 2798 2847	My grandmother was a   fiercely independent woman
T29	Plain_Folks 2849 2871	She helped to raise me
T30	Plain_Folks 2873 2907	She didnt have a   college degree.
T31	Plain_Folks 2908 3133	She worked her way up, working on bomber assembly lines   -- Rosie the Riveter -- during the war, and then went on, got a job as a   secretary and then kept on working her way up until she was vice   president of a local bank
T32	Plain_Folks 3135 3199	And after my grandfather died, she chose to   live independently
T33	Plain_Folks 3201 3268	And Medicare and Social Security allowed her to   make that choice.
T34	Plain_Folks 3269 3444	She had the confidence that,   having worked hard, played by the rules, she was rewarded with a safe   foundation for retirement and she could not fall through those cracks.  
T35	Plain_Folks 3511 3661	And   as a grateful grandson -- who happens to be President -- that is a   promise I'm going to make sure we're going to keep for future   generations
T39	Emotional_Anecdotes 2908 3133	She worked her way up, working on bomber assembly lines   -- Rosie the Riveter -- during the war, and then went on, got a job as a   secretary and then kept on working her way up until she was vice   president of a local bank
T41	Emotional_Anecdotes 3201 3268	And Medicare and Social Security allowed her to   make that choice.
T43	Glittering_Generalities 3445 3509	That was a promise this country made to her and all its citizens
T44	Glittering_Generalities 3269 3441	She had the confidence that,   having worked hard, played by the rules, she was rewarded with a safe   foundation for retirement and she could not fall through those cracks
T45	Glittering_Generalities 3511 3662	And   as a grateful grandson -- who happens to be President -- that is a   promise I'm going to make sure we're going to keep for future   generations.
T47	Patriotism 3776 3899	We have to work to do more to ensure that every older American   has the resources and the support that they need to thrive
T48	Glittering_Generalities 3776 3899	We have to work to do more to ensure that every older American   has the resources and the support that they need to thrive
T49	Glittering_Generalities 3901 4211	That   challenge -- protecting our seniors, dealing with the rising costs of an   aging generation, ensuring we have enough home care workers looking out   for our family members -- maximizing the contributions   that older Americans can make to our country -- these challenges are   just becoming more urgent.
T50	Patriotism 3901 4211	That   challenge -- protecting our seniors, dealing with the rising costs of an   aging generation, ensuring we have enough home care workers looking out   for our family members -- maximizing the contributions   that older Americans can make to our country -- these challenges are   just becoming more urgent.
T51	Fear 3901 4211	That   challenge -- protecting our seniors, dealing with the rising costs of an   aging generation, ensuring we have enough home care workers looking out   for our family members -- maximizing the contributions   that older Americans can make to our country -- these challenges are   just becoming more urgent.
T52	Patriotism 4227 4288	When we won   World War II, everyone came home and had babies
T53	Testimonial 4601 4639	Diana Nyad is here today, by   the way
T55	Plain_Folks 5223 5240	Look at this hair
T56	Plain_Folks 5108 5221	And since Im living out dog years   here in the presidency -- this is something Im paying a   lot of attention to
T57	Plain_Folks 5242 5266	Although I do have hair.
T58	Credit_Claiming 5323 5553	So since these golden years   are coming pretty fast, I want to make sure that we briefly focus on   what weve done to strengthen already Medicare, and take a longer look   at what we have to do to strengthen retirement even more.
T60	Credit_Claiming 6161 6331	Since I signed the   Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- since we   signed the ACA into law, weve extended the life of the Medicare Trust   Fund by 13 years
T61	Credit_Claiming 6333 6514	Were moving Medicare towards payment models that   require quality of care instead of quantity of care as the measure of   what you get paid, creating a different set of incentives.
T62	Patriotism 6515 6606	And thats   something that will keep older Americans healthy and Medicare healthy as   well
T63	Credit_Claiming 6608 6729	Whats more, this law has saved over 9 million people on Medicare   currently more than $15 billion on their prescriptions
T64	Credit_Claiming 6807 6926	Built into the   Affordable Care Act, 9 million seniors have gotten significant discounts   on their prescription drugs
T65	Credit_Claiming 6928 7036	They dont always know that its because   of Obamacare, but thats why theyve been paying cheaper drug prices.
T66	Credit_Claiming 7039 7124	Its also given nearly 40 million people on Medicare free preventive   health services
T67	Credit_Claiming 7126 7340	And weve expanded the options for home- and   community-based services offered by Medicaid, which means that more   older Americans are able to make the same choice that my grandmother did   and live independently.
T68	Credit_Claiming 7341 7385	So those are some areas   weve made progress
T69	Testimonial 7387 7615	And Sylvia Burwell, whos here, our Secretary of   Health and Human Services, Im sure at some point during this conference   will be talking about additional steps that we need to be taking to   further improve a delivery system.
T72	Testimonial 8328 8396	And its not as if they havent tried -- Vicki touched on   this issue
T73	Repetition 8441 8455	really, really
T74	Stereotyping 8398 8533	There are a lot of folks out here who work really, really   hard, but at the end of the day just still dont have enough of a nest   egg
T75	Stereotyping 8150 8327	Now, even as were dealing   with the health care side, we also know that too many older Americans   leave the workforce without having saved enough for a dignified   retirement.
T76	Fear 8535 8597	In todays economy, preparing for retirement has gotten tougher
T77	Fear 8398 8533	There are a lot of folks out here who work really, really   hard, but at the end of the day just still dont have enough of a nest   egg
T78	Fear 8599 8793	First of all, most workers   dont have a traditional pension -- what we used to understand as a   defined benefit pension where you were guaranteed a certain amount every   year once you retired
T79	Fear 8795 8857	A Social Security check on its own oftentimes is   not enough.
T80	Credit_Claiming 8858 9260	And even though, as a consequence of some of the steps that   we took, we pulled ourselves out of a terrible financial crisis and the   stock market has now doubled since I took office -- which means that   its replenished the 401(k)s for millions of families -- so thats been important for millions of families across the country,   but a lot of people dont have any kind of retirement account at all.
T81	Fear 9196 9259	a lot of people dont have any kind of retirement account at all
T82	Patriotism 9622 9753	Step number two -- for   Americans who are doing the hard work of saving for retirement, lets   make sure that they get a fair deal
T83	Glittering_Generalities 9622 9753	Step number two -- for   Americans who are doing the hard work of saving for retirement, lets   make sure that they get a fair deal
T84	Credit_Claiming 9755 9895	Earlier this year, I announced new   steps were taking to protect Americans by cracking down on conflicts of   interest in retirement advice
T85	Name_Calling 9897 10036	The goal here is to put an end to Wall   Street brokers who benefit from backdoor payments or hidden fees at the   expense of their clients
T86	Credit_Claiming 9897 10036	The goal here is to put an end to Wall   Street brokers who benefit from backdoor payments or hidden fees at the   expense of their clients
T87	Credit_Claiming 10202 10336	And for the many   brokers out there who are doing the right thing, this rule levels the   playing field for them and their customers.
T88	Credit_Claiming 10337 10428	The notion here is, is we   want to make sure responsibility is rewarded and not exploited.
T89	Credit_Claiming 10429 10490	So   theres a consumer protection element to this whole thing
T92	Name_Calling 11069 11141	Now, unfortunately, Congress   has repeatedly failed to act on this idea
T93	Name_Calling 11239 11270	Congress is not doing its work,
T95	Name_Calling 11953 12042	t is perverse that in this country it is just easier to save if   youve already got money
T96	Repetition 12590 12628	And thats just fair.   Thats only fair
T99	Credit_Claiming 13028 13272	As many of you know, over the past year, weve held   regional forums with AARP across the country, heard lots of ideas from   people, including folks in this room, about how we can make things   better -- especially for families and caregivers.
T107	Slogans 14163 14188	Its the right thing to do
T108	Glittering_Generalities 14670 14870	Weve grown so accustomed to these programs being a part of   American life -- these bedrock, foundation stones of our society --   sometimes its easy to forget how revolutionary they were at the time.
T110	Patriotism 14670 14869	Weve grown so accustomed to these programs being a part of   American life -- these bedrock, foundation stones of our society --   sometimes its easy to forget how revolutionary they were at the time
T117	Slogans 15229 15259	change has   always been hard.
T120	Glittering_Generalities 14164 14189	ts the right thing to do.
T121	Slogans 14435 14464	And its the right thing to do
T122	Glittering_Generalities 14435 14464	And its the right thing to do
T123	Glittering_Generalities 15332 15371	But ultimately, hope triumphs over fear
T124	Slogans 15348 15371	hope triumphs over fear
T125	Glittering_Generalities 15373 15417	We   choose to do big things here in America
T126	Patriotism 15373 15417	We   choose to do big things here in America
T130	Credit_Claiming 15679 15810	This generation, we chose to go even further, and now   health care in America is more affordable and available than ever   before.
T132	Glittering_Generalities 15811 16202	In this anniversary of those   incredible achievements, we need to recommit ourselves to finishing the   work that earlier generations began-- make sure this is a country that   remains one where no matter who you are or where you started off, youre   treated with dignity, your hard work is rewarded, your contributions are   valued, you have a shot to achieve your dreams whatever your age
T133	Patriotism 15679 15809	This generation, we chose to go even further, and now   health care in America is more affordable and available than ever   before
T134	Patriotism 15553 15677	Two generations ago, we chose to end   an age when Americans in their golden years didnt have the guarantee of   health care
T135	Patriotism 15419 15551	Like I said a couple weeks   back -- three generations ago, we chose to end the era where seniors   were left to languish in poverty
T136	Patriotism 16204 16244	Thats the America were all   working for
T137	Credit_Claiming 16204 16244	Thats the America were all   working for
T11	Glittering_Generalities 1655 1739	Medicare, Medicaid, Social   Security are some of our greatest triumphs as a nation.
T12	Testimonial 4682 4810	Arguably the toughest justice on the Supreme Court is the   oldest -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- also known as the   Notorious R.B.G
T13	Glittering_Generalities 4984 5107	And all of   us, as a consequence, are able to raise our own ambitions about what we   hope to achieve in our golden years.
T14	Glittering_Generalities 5323 5553	So since these golden years   are coming pretty fast, I want to make sure that we briefly focus on   what weve done to strengthen already Medicare, and take a longer look   at what we have to do to strengthen retirement even more.
T17	Fear 5554 5624	Now, were often told that   Medicare and Social Security are in crisis
T19	Credit_Claiming 5765 5898	Medicare and Social Security   are not in crisis, nor have they kept us from cutting our deficits by   two-thirds since I took office
T20	Credit_Claiming 5993 6160	And for   Medicare, that means weve got to keep slowing the growth of health care   costs, and keep building on the progress weve already made in the past   few years.
T24	Name_Calling 7930 7944	too much waste
T25	Name_Calling 8028 8055	a really inefficient system
T36	Repetition 12137 12168	the   mechanics, the mechanisms
T37	Patriotism 12913 13026	So this is just one of a   number of steps that were going to be taking to improve the lives of   older Americans
T38	Glittering_Generalities 13665 13820	Were going to work with Congress to reauthorize the   Older Americans Act -- because we know it will provide   critical support to families and communities
T40	Testimonial 14972 15136	When President Kennedy and President   Johnson -- and the Dingells -- worked to create Medicare, cynics raised   the alarm about government takeover of health care.
T42	Name_Calling 15069 15075	cynics
T46	Glittering_Generalities 15216 15259	The point is change has   always been hard.
T54	Name_Calling 15260 15270	Detractors
T59	Glittering_Generalities 15553 15677	Two generations ago, we chose to end   an age when Americans in their golden years didnt have the guarantee of   health care
